# ETL Pipeline Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Vantaa job applications ETL pipeline, which fetches open job applications from the city of Vantaa's API and loads them into a SQLite database.

### Pipeline Modification Decision
While the task instructions mentioned that reasonable modifications to the pipeline were allowed, we decided to keep the original implementation unchanged for the following reasons:
- The existing pipeline code is simple and functional
- The implementation follows clear separation of concerns (Extract, Transform, Load)
- The current code structure allows for comprehensive testing without modifications

However, if we were to modify the pipeline, we would consider the following improvements:
- Add input validation in the Transformer class to catch data issues early
- Implement basic retry logic in the Extractor for network resilience
- Add logging throughout the pipeline for better debugging
- Include data quality checks in the Transformer
- Add error handling for database connection issues in the Loader

The focus was on implementing a thorough testing strategy that matches the simplicity and purpose of the pipeline.

### Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Data Validation**
   - Basic input structure verification
   - Date format validation
   - Required field presence checks
   - Null value preservation

2. **Error Handling**
   - HTTP error handling via requests
   - Basic data transformation error catching
   - Database operation error handling

3. **Test Coverage Priorities**
   - Core ETL functionality
   - Data transformation accuracy
   - Basic error scenarios
   - Integration points

### Best Practices Implemented

1. **Test Organization**
   - Clear test categorization (7 distinct test files)
   - Logical file structure
   - Focused test cases
   - Comprehensive error scenarios

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip for installing dependencies
- Docker (optional, but recommended)
- SQLite3

### Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Initialize test database:
```bash
python main.py --method init
```

### Running Test Suite

#### Local Environment
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_unit.py -v

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=pipeline tests/

# Run tests by marker
pytest -v -m "integration"

# Run tests with detailed output
pytest -v --capture=no
```

#### Docker Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build . -t etl-tests

# Run all tests in container
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/etl etl-tests pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/etl etl-tests pytest tests/test_unit.py -v

# Run with coverage
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/etl etl-tests pytest --cov=pipeline tests/
```

### Test Output
- Test results will show pass/fail status for each test
- Coverage report indicates code coverage percentage
- Failed tests will show detailed error messages and stack traces

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure database is initialized before running tests
- Check Python version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- For Docker, ensure volume mounting is correct

## Intentionally Omitted Tests

The following types of tests were intentionally omitted as they would be excessive for this simple ETL pipeline:

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Not needed due to small data volume
   - SQLite is sufficient for the scale
   - Simple transformations don't require optimization

2. **Complex Data Validation**
   - Basic type checking is sufficient
   - URL validation unnecessary as data comes from trusted source
   - Coordinate validation not critical for storage purpose

3. **Advanced Error Recovery**
   - Simple error reporting is adequate
   - Retry mechanisms unnecessary for basic pipeline
   - Complex transaction handling not required for single-table operations

4. **Connection Pool Testing**
   - SQLite file-based connection is simple
   - No concurrent access scenarios
   - Single-user operation assumed

5. **Incremental Load Testing**
   - Pipeline performs full loads only
   - No historical data tracking needed
   - Simple overwrite strategy is sufficient

These omissions align with the "lazy data engineer" context and keep the testing suite focused on essential functionality without over-engineering.
